## Usage

The `#b22222` colour is a dark red colour, also known as firebrick.
It is a web safe colour.
The #b22 colour hex could be obtained by blending #ff4444 with #640000.
Closest websafe colour is: #cc3333.

```{.r}
my_colour <- "#b22222"
```

`rgb(10, 100, 200)` or `rgb(10,100,200)` is a blue colour and `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)` is a colour too.  
But it does not work with rgb(10,100,200) and hsl(240,100%,50%).
